# React Native Braille Six Key Input

_To have this render your input as Braille, you will need to import a Braille font, like the [SimBraille Font](http://www.brl.org/simbraille.html 'BRL: Braille Through Remote Learning Web Site, SimBraille Font Page.') or the AppleBraille font that comes with Apple Mac OS computers, into your Project._
