# React Native Braille Six Key Input

### An NPM Package for React Native for a Six-Key Input Overlay for Braille Characters on mobile smart devices.

_To have this render your input as Braille, you will need to import a Braille font, like the [SimBraille Font](http://www.brl.org/simbraille.html 'BRL: Braille Through Remote Learning Web Site, SimBraille Font Page.') or the AppleBraille font that comes with Apple Mac OS computers, into your Project._

**To Install**:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-braille-six-key-input
```

**To Install & Save as a Dependency in your `package.json`**:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-braille-six-key-input --save
```

After installing package, make sure to install all NPM dependencies for your project from the root of your project —

```bash
$ npm i
```

We have also included a sample App running with this Six-Key Input, to see that, `cd` into the App directory and run `npm i` there, then `npm start`, and it will run it in Expo for you (you will need to install [Expo](https://expo.io/) on your Smart Phone to see it run) —

```bash
$ cd App
$ npm i
...
$ npm start
```

To have the App run, you need to follow **_both_** steps above for running `npm i` in both the Package _and_ the App directories.

Once the app is running, try various key combinations for Braille letters you can find at [this Braille web site](https://www.pharmabraille.com/pharmaceutical-braille/the-braille-alphabet/).

### Coming in the future —

- For Tablets, angled fingered buttons in landscape mode.
- Accessability speech.
- Optional Light-colored background
