# React Native Braille Six Key Input
### An NPM Package for React Native for a Six-Key Input Overlay for Braille Characters on mobile smart phones.

_To have this render your input as Braille, you will need to import the [SimBraille Font](http://www.brl.org/simbraille.html "BRL: Braille Through Remote Learning Web Site, SimBraille Font Page.") into your Project._

**To Install**:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-braille-six-key-input
```

**To Install & Save as a Dependency in your `package.json`**:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-braille-six-key-input --save
```
After installing package, make sure to install all NPM dependencies for your project from the root of your project —

```bash
$ npm i
```

We have also included a sample App running with this Six-Key Input, to see that, `cd` into the App directory and run `npm i` there, then `npm start`, and it will run it in Expo for you (you will need to install [Expo](https://expo.io/) on your Smart Phone to see it run) —

```bash
$ cd App
$ npm i
...
$ npm start
```
Once the app is running, try various key combinations for Braille letters you can at [this Braille web site](https://www.pharmabraille.com/pharmaceutical-braille/the-braille-alphabet/).

### Coming in the future —

*  Responsive design to handle Landscape orientation & different screen sizes (for now, it is only in Portrait orientation)
*  Backspace/Delete Key
*  Optional Light-colored background
*  Keys Multi-touch highlight when pressed
*  Better ability to handle Braille Numbers and Contractions
